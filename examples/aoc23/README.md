# Advent of Code 2023

## intro
[Sharpl](https://github.com/codr7/sharpl/tree/main) was created in an attempt to build a more ergonomic language for problem solving.<br/>

For many years I used Common Lisp, the least painful alternative I could find; to solve the [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/).
But as I spent more and more time hacking interpreters and designing my own tiny languages, a crazy idea started growing in my mind.<br/>

Bending Common Lisp into a nice tool is not an easy task, it contains most of the bits and pieces but is loaded with quirks for historical reasons.
Scheme is too religious for my taste, Clojure even more so.<br/>

There are other languages; but I have found none that offer the same kind of power in a coherent, modern package.<br/>

I also like the idea of embedding languages, because having access to two complementing languages is a lot better than one.

## status
It's a work in progress, the plan is to solve the first part of each problem and leave the second as an exercise.
